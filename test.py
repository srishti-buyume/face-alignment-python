Professional Experience:
- During my 6 months internship at iNeuron which also served as a certification training programming, I learned to implement end-to-end data science and machine learning pipeline, where i collected data from various sources (web scraping, etc.), did pre-processing (EDA, etc), applied ML models for advance analytics and predictive modelling (House price prediction), and deployed the project on AWS EC2 instance.
- One of the capstone project I worked on was - "some priect name - that involved working with image data using computer vision techniques and deep learning, training models like YOLO for object detection.
- I worked on various classical NLP problems like sentiment analysis, and several computer vision projects such as object detection and image classification along with classical machine learning algorithms such as Decusion trees for XYZ project.
